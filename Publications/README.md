### 1. **Data-Driven Sustainable Design Opportunities from Automated User Insights**
- **Authors:** Goridkov, A., Ng, Z. W., Chen, F., and Goucher-Lambert, K.  
- **Venue:** *ASME IDETC-CIE 2025*, Anaheim, California â€” Published in conference proceedings (IDETC2025-169019).  
- **Abstract:**  
  This paper introduces an automated NLP-based framework that extracts design-relevant sustainability insights from large-scale online reviews.  
  Using BERT, VADER, LDA, NMF, and OpenAI APIs, the study identifies correlations between consumer sentiment and sustainability attributes,  
  revealing opportunities for sustainable product redesign and certification alignment.

### 2. **Enhanced Equipment Reliability Through Predictive Maintenance Modeling: A Machine Learning Approach**
- **Author:** Ng, Z. W.  
- **Venue:** *Sustainability (MDPI, Q2 SCI)*, 17 (19), 8848 (2025).  
- **Abstract:**  
  This study applies machine-learning-based predictive maintenance (PdM) modeling to industrial reliability optimization.  
  Using time-series datasets and LSTM-based architectures, it compares RNN, Conv-LSTM, and Bi-LSTM variants to forecast equipment failures.  
  Results show that a convolutional Bi-LSTM model achieves the best predictive performance, demonstrating strong potential for practical PdM deployment.

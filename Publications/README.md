### 1. **Machine Learning-Aided Supply Chain Analysis of Waste Management Systems: System Optimization for Sustainable Production**
- **Authors:** Ng, Z. W.*, Debnath, B., & Chattopadhyay, A. K.* (*Corresponding Authors*)
- **Venue:** *Sustainability (MDPI, Q2 SCI)*, 17 (19), 8848 (2025):contentReference[oaicite:0]{index=0}  
- **Summary:**  
  Developed a machine-learning-driven framework for circular e-waste supply-chain optimization, combining Feedforward Neural Networks, Random Forest models, and Monte Carlo simulation to address data sparsity and model system resilience. Achieved \(R^2â‰ˆ0.97\) across 21 variables, identifying key economic and environmental levers governing supply-chain sustainability.

### 2. **Data-Driven Sustainable Design Opportunities from Automated User Insights**
- **Authors:** Goridkov, N., Ng, Z. W., Chen, F., & Goucher-Lambert, K.  
- **Venue:** *Proceedings of the ASME 2025 International Design Engineering Technical Conferences & Computers and Information in Engineering Conference (IDETC-CIE 2025)*, Anaheim, CA â€” Paper IDETC2025-169019:contentReference[oaicite:1]{index=1}  
- **Summary:**  
  Built a database of 23 000 Amazon reviews covering 290 sustainability-certified products and applied BERT, VADER, LDA, NMF, and GPT-based analysis to extract design-relevant sustainability signals. Generated automated insights linking user sentiment to product certifications, revealing how consumers perceive and value sustainable features in practice.

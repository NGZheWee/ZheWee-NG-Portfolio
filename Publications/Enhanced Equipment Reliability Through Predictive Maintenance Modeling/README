# Enhanced Equipment Reliability Through Predictive Maintenance Modeling

This paper, currently under review for publication, explores advanced predictive maintenance (PdM) techniques using machine learning methods such as Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks to enhance equipment reliability. By predicting equipment failures and analyzing time-series data from industrial operations, the study aims to minimize operational downtime and increase productivity.

The paper compares various machine learning models, including Recurrent Neural Networks (RNN), Convolutional LSTM, and Bi-LSTM, demonstrating that the Convolutional Bi-LSTM model excels in predicting failures, making it a promising solution for industrial predictive maintenance.

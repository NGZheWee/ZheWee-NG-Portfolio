### 1. **Enhanced Equipment Reliability Through Predictive Maintenance Modeling**
- **Authors**: NG Zhe Wee
- **Status**: Under Review
- **Abstract**: 
  This paper explores advanced predictive maintenance (PdM) techniques using machine learning methods such as Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks to enhance equipment reliability. By predicting equipment failures and analyzing time-series data from industrial operations, the study aims to minimize operational downtime and increase productivity.

  The paper compares various machine learning models, including Recurrent Neural Networks (RNN), Convolutional LSTM, and Bi-LSTM. The Convolutional Bi-LSTM model was shown to excel in predicting failures, making it a promising solution for industrial predictive maintenance.

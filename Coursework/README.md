# Courses Taken for Computer Science

This page provides an overview of the courses I have completed throughout my computer science studies, covering both core computer science subjects and relevant mathematics courses. The computer science section comes first, detailing the topics I've covered in areas like programming, algorithms, systems, and specialized topics such as AI and machine learning. Following that, you'll find a list of the math courses that have laid the theoretical foundation for these concepts.

For many of the courses that involved substantial programming projects or practical assignments, I have created GitHub repositories to showcase the work I completed. You will find links to these repositories in the table below where applicable. Not every course required programming work, so only those with relevant projects will have a corresponding GitHub repository link.

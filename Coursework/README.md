## Math Courses for Computer Science

Throughout my academic journey, I have completed several math courses that provide the necessary theoretical and practical foundation in key areas such as calculus, differential equations, discrete mathematics, probability theory, and linear algebra. These courses have equipped me with the skills to approach challenges in algorithm optimization, data analysis, machine learning, and theoretical computation. Below is a structured list of the math courses I have taken, organized by their respective mathematical domains.

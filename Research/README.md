This repository highlights my research projects, which focus on applying AI techniques to analyze and interpret data for interdisciplinary applications in sustainable design, advanced manufacturing processes, and biomedical innovations.

## Featured Research

### Research Assistant – Berkeley Engineering Design Scholars Program & Co-Design Lab
**Jacobs Institute for Design Innovation & Department of Mechanical Engineering, UC Berkeley**  
*June 2024 – Present*

- Leading research on sustainable design, initiated during the **Berkeley Engineering Design Scholars Program** and continuing under the **Co-Design Lab** with Dr. Kosa Goucher-Lambert.
- Utilized natural language processing (NLP) to analyze certification data and customer reviews, delivering insights into how certifications influence consumer perceptions.
- Developed web scraping tools using DrissionPage, Selenium, and BeautifulSoup to extract and analyze Amazon product data, automating pagination, login, and data extraction with error handling.
- Conducted sentiment analysis comparing LLMs, BERT, and VADER using correlation matrices and aspect-based analysis in Python. Applied LDA topic modeling to assess customer perceptions and inform sustainable design strategies.

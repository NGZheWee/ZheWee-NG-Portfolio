# Research Projects by Zhe Wee (Derrick) Ng

This repository highlights my research projects, focusing on applying advanced AI techniques to analyze and interpret data for interdisciplinary applications, including sustainable design, 3D video generation, and dynamic scene rendering.

## Featured Research

### Research Assistant – Berkeley Engineering Design Scholars Program & Co-Design Lab
**Jacobs Institute for Design Innovation & Department of Mechanical Engineering, UC Berkeley**  
*June 2024 – Present*

- Conducted research on sustainable design, initiated during the **Berkeley Engineering Design Scholars Program** and continuing under the **Co-Design Lab** with Dr. Kosa Goucher-Lambert.
- Developed web scraping tools using **DrissionPage**, **Selenium**, and **BeautifulSoup** to extract and analyze Amazon product data, automating pagination, login, and error handling.
- Applied NLP techniques in Python, including:
  - **Aspect-Based Sentiment Analysis (ABSA)** with models like **BERT**, **VADER**, and **OpenAI’s API**.
  - **Topic modeling** using **LDA** and **NMF** to assess customer perceptions.
- Evaluated correlations between sustainability certifications and consumer sentiment using correlation matrices, providing actionable insights for sustainable product design.

### Research Assistant – Diffusive AI Lab
**Tsinghua University, Beijing, China**  
*October 2024 – Present*

- Part of the **Diffusive AI Lab**, guided by Dr. Zheng Zhu, working on a scalable, diffusion-driven 3D video generation system with a focus on:
  - Persistent state tracking across frames.
  - Dynamic, text-based scene modifications.
- Implementing advanced state-tracking mechanisms:
  - **Environmental encoding** with attention-enhanced VAEs.
  - **Action-based updates** driven by LSTMs trained on sequential data for consistent object placement and temporal coherence.
- Developing a text-prompted scene modification framework that includes:
  - **LLM-driven command parsing** and **cross-attention transformers** for text-to-scene alignment.
  - A **dynamic scene graph** to enable real-time updates and coherent rendering.
- Leveraging diffusion models to enhance 3D scene synthesis with fine-grained control over dynamic modifications.

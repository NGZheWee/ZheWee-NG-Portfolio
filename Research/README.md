# Research Projects by Zhe Wee (Derrick) Ng

This repository showcases my research projects that apply advanced Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning techniques across sustainability, natural-language processing, and multimodal forecasting.  
Each project integrates data-driven modeling and real-world impact within domains such as supply-chain optimization, sustainable design, and autonomous robotics.

## Lead Researcher – Machine Learning-Aided Supply Chain Analysis  
**Independent Research Project**  
*April 2024 – October 2025*

- Led a quantitative study applying machine learning to optimize **circular waste-management supply chains**, modeling the interaction of cost, logistics, and environmental factors.  
- Built a **MATLAB–Python framework** integrating Feedforward Neural Networks, Random Forests, and Monte Carlo simulations for **parameter sensitivity and efficiency optimization**.  
- Achieved predictive accuracy of **R² ≈ 0.97** across 21 sustainability variables and identified key process levers driving system performance and emission outcomes.  
- First and corresponding author of the paper published in *Sustainability (MDPI, Q2 SCI)*, **17 (19), 8848 (2025)**.

## Research Assistant – Berkeley Engineering Design Scholars Program & Co-Design Lab  
**Jacobs Institute for Design Innovation & Department of Mechanical Engineering, UC Berkeley**  
*June 2024 – May 2025*

- Contributed to **data-driven sustainable-design research**, integrating user-centered design principles with advanced NLP pipelines under the mentorship of **Dr. Kosa Goucher-Lambert**.  
- Built a database of **23 000 + Amazon reviews** spanning 290 sustainability-certified products through automated web-scraping using DrissionPage and structured data workflows.  
- Applied Python-based NLP methods including **BERT**, **VADER**, **LDA**, **NMF**, and **OpenAI API** for sentiment analysis, topic modeling, and correlation analysis to extract actionable sustainability insights.  
- Co-author of a peer-reviewed paper presented at **ASME IDETC-CIE 2025 (Anaheim, CA)**, published in the conference proceedings (**IDETC2025-169019**).

## Research Assistant – Squishy Robotics, Berkeley Expert Systems Technologies Lab  
**Department of Mechanical Engineering, UC Berkeley**  
*January 2025 – May 2025*

- Conducted exploratory data analysis on the **Corsican Fire Database** to identify modality imbalance and missing annotations.  
- Implemented **computer-vision and Gemini-based pipelines** for data augmentation and labeling to enhance RGB–IR coverage and descriptor completeness.  
- Designed a **descriptor-guided multimodal forecasting framework** combining RGB, IR, and textual descriptors through **EfficientNet**, **ViT**, and **BERT-based late-fusion with LSTM** temporal modeling for wildfire-spread and intensity prediction.  
- Delivered an interpretable, deployable forecasting module integrated into **Squishy Robotics’ autonomous wildfire-response platform**, generating visual–language outputs for real-time validation and field deployment.

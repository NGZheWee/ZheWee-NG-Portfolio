# Sustainable Design Insights Project

This project was completed as part of the [2024 Berkeley Engineering Design Scholars Program](https://jacobsinstitute.berkeley.edu/news/meet-the-2024-berkeley-engineering-design-scholars/), a competitive program that brings together top engineering students to tackle innovative design challenges. As a scholar in this program and a member of the [Co-Design Lab](https://codesign.berkeley.edu/team/derrick-ng/), I focused on using advanced **Natural Language Processing (NLP)** techniques, specifically **Aspect-Based Sentiment Analysis (ABSA)**, to extract detailed insights from customer reviews and sustainability certification data.

The project involved scraping extensive datasets from online platforms and analyzing the sentiments expressed in customer reviews about products with sustainability certifications. By leveraging ABSA, the research identified specific aspects of products that customers found successful or problematic, helping to inform sustainable product design improvements.

The repository for this project is organized into several folders, including key directories for **programs** and **databases** used throughout the research. The **programs** folder contains Python scripts that implement the Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques used for data scraping, cleaning, and analysis. These include the sentiment analysis models, such as Aspect-Based Sentiment Analysis (ABSA), which were applied to the customer review datasets. The **databases** folder houses the datasets collected from online platforms like Amazon, including product reviews and information related to sustainability certifications. These structured datasets were essential for running the NLP models and extracting insights related to product performance and sustainability.
